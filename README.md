# AIDS-Classification-using-Artificial-Neural-Networks-and-Random-Forest
This project focuses on classifying data related to AIDS using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) built with PyTorch and Random Forest classifiers. The main aim is to explore different configurations for training ANNs and compare their performance to traditional machine learning models like Random Forest.
